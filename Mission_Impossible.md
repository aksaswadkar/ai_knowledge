### [So thrilling](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10516720/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_1_hd)

Simply amazing action film. I'm a sucker for mission imposisble movies and this one was a cherry on top. Watched it in Imax and the sound effects were making me genuinely stress out during all the high action scenes. Although characters and their developments aren't focused on in films like these except the few recurring ones, it is still thoroughly enjoyable and every actor performs very well. All the simultaneous pressure and "very last moment" is very mission impossible but I love it, some people might find it a bit repetitive, but I think its the charm of the movies. All the tie ins, all the thought and love gone into this film is very apparent. Very high quality.

### [Exposition: The Movie - And some action scenes, too](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10518151/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_2_hd)

The movie has two really good parts: the underwater sequence in the submarine and the insane plane stunt - aka Tom Cruise signature craziness. You gotta respect that level of filmmaking, and I'm happy that stuff like this still exists.

However, when it comes to actual content, the movie is mostly filled with characters explaining, over and over again, what they are doing and what's going to happen next, embedded in overly dramatic and exaggerated dialogue. Sorry, but that's just not good writing - it's exposition dumping.

The rest is basically run-of-the-mill action sequences and plot devices that lead to a pretty predictable and not-very-exciting plot. So while the movie is still entertaining, you're left with the bittersweet realization that this farewell to the Mission: Impossible franchise could have been just a bit more.

### [A great ending?](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10516759/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_3_hd)

This movie successfully concluded this 30-year-old franchise. The action was superb but not over-the-top. There are a lot of characters from the past that being brought back naturally, which I feel is a nice touch. It serves their purpose and doesn't feel out of place or forced. However, not all are to my liking - the twist wasn't as impressive as previous movies and the plot felt a bit linear and thin. It's almost 3 hours so I feels like a road trip rather than a roller coaster. Despite this, I enjoyed the ride and it reminded me of what MI is really about: "We live and die in the shadows, for those we hold close, and those we never meet."

### [Solid ending if it is, more great action set pieces](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10516628/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_4_hd)

'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning' is the 8th and possibly final film in the franchise. Pretty impressive that Tom Cruise has been steadily making these for 30 years, without over-saturating the market. This is a direct sequel to 'Dead Reckoning', with Ethan (Cruise) in possession of the key to stop the malevolent AI called "The Entity". This means he comes out of the shadows a bit, and interacts with the US President (Bassett) and General Sidney (Offerman).

The plot means Ethan has to retrieve something from a sunken submarine, which is arguably the tensest scene in the film, as well as possibly the most unbelievable, but is expertly done. We also get to see the team from the previous film back - long-timers Luther (Rhames), Benji (Pegg), Kittridge (Czerny), plus returnees Grace (Atwell), Paris (Klementieff) and antagonist Gabriel (Morales). The best call-back though is Donloe (Saxon) and how he's important to the story. As much as it's all about Ethan, it's always good to see the IMF team in action.

Similar to the last film, it's shot around the world - London, Norway, South Africa. The stunts in the bi-planes flying over the South African coast are particularly stunning, and amazing to know that Cruise is literally hanging on those planes himself. While perhaps not as cohesive as 'Fallout' or 'Dead Reckoning', at 2 hours 45min there's plenty of action to get through. Less espionage, and more "convince the armed forces not to blow each other up", making sure the stakes are high. Less trademark-Tom-running than usual, but plenty of fight scenes, bomb diffusions and stunts galore.

### [Mission accomplished](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw10516283/?ref_=tt_ururv_c_5_hd)

A globe-trotting and pulse-pounding triumph. The Final Reckoning has its limitations and odd dramatic fixations, but it holds together as a massive cinematic experience filled with exhilarating, nail-biting, armrest-grabbing tension. Cementing its place as one of cinema's most consistent franchises, the film's breathtaking scale and death-defying stunts make for a blockbuster masterclass. Continuing Cruise and McQuarrie's intrepid crusade against the rising use of AI, it's hard not to enjoy the duo at home in their element, delivering yet more jaw-dropping stunts and globe-trotting adventure, overflowing with overly complex plot and escalating complication upon complication. In many ways, this is less an action film and more a disaster flick. Where worst-case scenarios were once implied, they are now visualised with apocalyptic projections. Gargantuan in action, runtime, and scope, The Final Recokoning completely embraces its grandiose nonsense. It acknowledges itself as huge, fun, silly, and emotionally rewarding, never attempting to restrain its exuberance, and we love it for that. A sentimental sendoff that accomplishes its mission with a characteristic flair for the impossible. Ethan can rest easy now. Mission accomplished Tom.
