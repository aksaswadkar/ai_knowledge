# Development
On January 14, 2019, Tom Cruise announced that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films would be shot back-to-back with Christopher McQuarrie writing and directing both films for July 23, 2021 and August 5, 2022, releases.[24][25] However, in February 2021, Deadline Hollywood revealed that Paramount had decided to no longer move forward with that plan.[26]

In September 2019, Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff joined the cast of the eighth installment.[27][28] In December, Simon Pegg confirmed his return for the film, while Shea Whigham was also cast.[29][30] Nicholas Hoult joined the cast by January 2020, along with Henry Czerny, who reprised his role as Eugene Kittridge from Dead Reckoning Part One and the first film.[31][32] However, due to scheduling conflicts, Hoult was replaced by Esai Morales for both films.[33] Vanessa Kirby, who first appeared in Fallout, announced she was returning for both films,[34] but did not appear in Final Reckoning.[35] In July 2022, it was reported that Holt McCallany had joined the cast.[36] In August, it was revealed Nick Offerman and Janet McTeer were also added to the cast.[37] In March 2023, McQuarrie announced Hannah Waddingham, Lucy Tulugarjuk and Rolf Saxon's addition to the cast, the latter of whom reprises his role from the first film.[12][38] In March and April 2024, respectively, Katy O'Brian and Tramell Tillman joined the cast in then-undisclosed roles.[21][15] In November 2024, it was revealed that Angela Bassett would reprise her role as CIA Director Erika Sloane.[39]

# Filming
In February 2021, Deadline Hollywood reported that the film would no longer be filmed back-to-back with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.[26] By November, McQuarrie was in the process of rewriting the film's script.[40] On March 23, 2022, The Hollywood Reporter reported the beginning of principal photography of the then untitled Mission: Impossible 8.[41] Filming took place in the UK at Longcross Studios and the Lake District. Other locations included Malta, South Africa, and Norway. In December 2022, filming was finished in the UK.[42] The crew then moved to Apulia in Italy to continue filming aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush.[43] During the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, production was thought to have been put on hold according to an interview with McQuarrie in the June 2023 issue of the Empire magazine.[44] However, this was later revealed to have been a misinterpretation of McQuarrie's statement, and continued production was only waiting for the promotion of Part One to complete.[45] Filming was officially suspended in July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[46] The film returned to production in March 2024, though in May, it encountered a delay due to a submarine malfunction.[47][48] During filming in England, Cruise and Morales were observed performing stunts from an airborne biplane, with Cruise holding onto the wings of the open cockpit aircraft as it flew upside down, while the pilot wore a greenscreen suit so as to be digitally removed from the final shot.[49] In July 2024, Simon Pegg revealed filming had concluded for his part, though the cast and crew were maintaining radio silence.[50][51] By November 2024, production had concluded and the film was in post-production. The Hollywood Reporter reported that the budget had neared $400 million due to the production delays.[3]

# Post-production
Industrial Light & Magic returns from the seventh film to produce the visual effects, with Clear Angle Studios and Halon Entertainment as the additional vendors for lidar, cyber scanning and previsualization.[52][53][54] In October 2023, Dead Reckoning Part Two was removed as the film's subtitle,[55] and the new subtitle was confirmed as The Final Reckoning in November 2024.[56]



# Music
Lorne Balfe was originally announced in May 2020 to be composing the film's score, after previously doing so for Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018) and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023),[57] but it was later announced in April 2025 that he would be replaced with Max Aruj and Alfie Godfrey. Aruj has previously provided additional music for Dead Reckoning and served as technical score assistant on Fallout. Both Aruj and Godfrey have contributed music to numerous projects scored by Balfe over the years. Cecile Tournesac was credited as the supervising music editor and score producer.[58] The full album was released on 23 May 2025.[59][60]


# Release
Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning had its world premiere in Tokyo on May 5, 2025. The film screened at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2025, prior to its scheduled theatrical release on May 23, by Paramount Pictures.[61][62] It was previously set for release on August 5, 2022,[63] but was delayed to November 4, 2022,[64] July 7, 2023,[65] June 28, 2024,[66] and then to the current date in response to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, taking the original release date of The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.[67] Due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the budget for the film reportedly increased to at least $400 million, placing it among the most expensive films ever made.[68] Based on typical industry expectations, the film may need to earn around $1 billion worldwide to recoup its production costs.[68] However, in addition to its box office, its performance on Paramount’s streaming service, Paramount+, is also expected to be a significant factor in evaluating its overall success.[68]

Internationally, it was released theatrically in Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, India and South Korea on May 17, 2025[69] before releasing in the United Kingdom on May 21.[70] The film was released in Dolby Cinema, ScreenX, RPX, 4DX, IMAX and other premium formats.
