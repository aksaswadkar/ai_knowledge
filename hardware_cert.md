Introduction to Red Hat Hardware Certification Program
The Red Hat Certification Program ensures compatibility of hardware and software products with Red Hat's offerings, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenStack Platform. This program consists of three main elements: a test suite for hardware or software applications undergoing certification, the Red Hat Certification Ecosystem to explore and find certified products, and a support framework that establishes a joint support relationship between partners and Red Hat. The certification encompasses a wide range of devices, such as servers, desktops, workstations, laptops, and individual components.
